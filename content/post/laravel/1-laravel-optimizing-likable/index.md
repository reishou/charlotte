The "likeable" feature in Laravel has become a staple for many developers.
You've probably searched the internet for ways to implement it, but in this
blog post, we'll take it a step further. We'll explore the common challenges
faced when using the likeable feature and unveil some powerful optimizations.

Imagine you're implementing the like feature for players. Typically, when
fetching a list of players, you need to determine whether the currently
logged-in user has liked a particular player. Let's try a clever approach
by leveraging Eloquent's accessor capabilities.

```php
public function getIsLikedAttribute()
{
    $liked = $this->likes()->where( 'user_id', auth()->id())->first();
    return (bool)$liked;
}
```

With this implementation, the returned data will include an `is_liked` field
that accurately reflects whether the logged-in user has liked each player or
not.

```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "id": 89573795441935385,
      "name": "Alex",
      "created_at": "2019-10-11T12:07:08+0000",
      "updated_at": "2020-05-17T14:00:12+0000",
      "is_liked": true
    },
    {
      "id": 89573795265774616,
      "name": "Alex",
      "created_at": "2019-10-11T12:07:08+0000",
      "updated_at": "2020-05-17T14:00:12+0000",
      "is_liked": false
    }
  ]
}
```

At first glance, this approach may seem simple and straightforward. However,
it presents a performance challenge when dealing with large datasets or
paginated results limited to 25 items.

```json
{
  "database": {
    "total": 29,
    "items": [
      {
        "connection": "mysql",
        "query": "select * from `likes` where `likes`.`likeable_id` = `194456710046286896` and `likes`.`likeable_id` is not null and `likes`.`likeable_tyPe` = `App\\Player` and `user_id` = `157426748995143158` and `likes`.`deleted_at` is null limit 1;",
        "time": 0.38
      },
      {
        "connection": "mysql",
        "query": "select * from `likes` where `likes`.`likeable_id` = `194456710021121071` and `likes`.`likeable_id. is not null and `likes`.`likeable_tyPe` = `App\\Player` and `user_id` = `157426748995143158` and `likes`.`deleted_at` is null limit 1;",
        "time": 0.29
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The culprit lies within the `getIsLikedAttribute()` method, where we
unintentionally fall into the notorious N+1 problem, executing an
additional query for each player. But fear not! We have an exciting
optimization technique to eliminate these performance bottlenecks.

```php
public function liked()
{
    return $this->morphOne(Like::class, 'likeable')
        ->where('user_id', auth()->id())
        ->select(rid', 'created_at', 'updated_at1);
}
```

Instead of executing queries within the accessor, we'll leverage a
powerful Eloquent relationship called liked. By utilizing the `with()`
method, we can eagerly load the liked relationship and transform the implementation.

```json
{
  "players": [
    {
      "id": 194456710046286896,
      "name": "Alex",
      "created_at": "2020-03-04T05:10:46+0000",
      "updated_at": "2020-05-17T14:00:12+0000",
      "liked": {
        "id": 241465878896444422,
        "likeable_id": 194456710046286896,
        "created_at": "2020-05-08T01:49:35+0000",
        "updated_at": "2020-05-21T04:12:15+0000"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 194456710021121071,
      "name": "Tom",
      "created_at": "2020-03-04T05:10:46+0000",
      "updated_at": "2020-05-17T14:00:12+0000",
      "liked": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Voil√†! The `is_liked` field has now become `liked`. It no longer represents a simple
boolean value but instead provides an object or null depending on the user's like
status. As a result, the number of queries dramatically decreases, and your
application's performance receives a significant boost.

```json
{
  "database": {
    "total": 4,
    "items": [
      {
        "connection": "mysql",
        "query": "select count(*) as aggregate from `players` where `players`.`deleted_at` is null;",
        "time": 2.55
      },
      {
        "connection": "mysql",
        "query": "select `id`, `sync_player_id`, `name`, `localized_name`, `gender`, `date_of_birth`, `registration_number`, `class`, `registered_date`, `nationality`, `prefecture_id`, `graduate`, `current_rank_code`, `next_rank_code`, `note`, `created_at`, `updated_at` from `players` where `players`.`deleted_at` is null order by `updated_at` desc, `id` desc limit 25 offset 0;",
        "time": 0.59
      },
      {
        "connection": "mysql",
        "query": "select `id`, `player_id`, `type, `expiration_date`, `deleted_date., `registered_date`, `updated_date` from `player_licenses` where `player_licenses`.`player_id` in (89573795265774616, 89573795441935385, 89573795735536666, 89573795911697435, 89573796079469596, 89573796222075933, 89573796398236702, 89573796574397471, 89573796725392416, 89573796876387361, 89573797044159522, 89573797220320291, 89573797413258276, 89573797606196261, 89573797773968422, 89573797924963367, 89573798075958312, 89573798243730473, 96879317530706986, 194456709912069163, 194456709937234988, 194456709970789421, 194456709995955246, 194456710021121071, 194456710046286896);",
